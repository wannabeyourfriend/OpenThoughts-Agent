"""render_agentic.py -- render captured shim prompts into agentic_*.html.

The OpenAI shim (serve_hf_openai.py) logs every request's fully-templated
prompt + response to a JSONL file. After running swe-agent against the shim,
this module picks a representative generation step (the FIRST model call for a
given run) and renders it via render_tokens.render_to_html, with the response
appended as the generated continuation.

This is also usable standalone to re-render an existing log without re-running
swe-agent.
