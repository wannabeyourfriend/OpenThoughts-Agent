"""Pull the COMPLETE log history for an iris job and produce summary statistics.

Log acquisition reads finelog directly rather than paginating ``iris job logs
--since-ms`` time windows (which were pathologically slow on long jobs). For a
logical job we:

  1. Enumerate the authoritative attempt/generation set from the iris controller
     SQLite (``task_attempts`` joined through ``tasks``/``jobs`` on
     ``root_job_id``/``job_id``), with each attempt's ``[started, finished]``
     window.
  2. Fetch every matching ``log`` row by ``key`` prefix from BOTH the LIVE
     finelog server (recent, locally-resident segments) AND the GCS parquet
     archive (uploaded L>=1 segments), then union and dedup on the server-stamped
     monotonic ``seq``. Neither source alone is complete.
  3. Assert COVERAGE: every enumerated attempt window must contain log rows with
     no internal gap larger than ``--max-coverage-gap-seconds``. If any window is
     uncovered (e.g. live unavailable for the recent L0 tail AND GCS has not yet
     archived it) we FAIL LOUDLY, listing the missing ``(log_key, window)``,
     unless ``--allow-incomplete`` is passed.

The completeness contract is non-negotiable: the script either returns every log
row across every attempt/generation or fails identifying the gap. The merged,
filtered stream is cached to ``/tmp/iris_history_<job>.filtered.log`` (coverage
result alongside in ``.coverage.json``) so re-runs are fast; ``--refresh``
re-fetches.

Three sections of stats are computed:
  §1 preemption count + time-to-preempt distribution
  §2 trace progress per cycle (from harbor GCS output)
  §3 serving throughput stats (full + warmup-excluded)

A markdown report is written to ``--output``; a JSON sidecar is written
alongside.

Run under the marin venv (``/Users/benjaminfeuer/Documents/marin/.venv/bin/
python``) so ``finelog``/``rigging``/``duckdb`` import. The LIVE path needs an
IAP session for the ``marin`` cluster (``marin-login login marin``); without it
the recent-L0 window is reported as uncovered rather than silently dropped.
