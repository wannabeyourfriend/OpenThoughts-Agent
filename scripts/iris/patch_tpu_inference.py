"""Apply runtime patches to the iris worker's pip-installed tpu-inference.

Invoked from the launcher's bash bootstrap *after* ``uv sync`` and
*before* the workload starts. Each patch is idempotent (skipped if
already applied) and prints a one-line status so the iris-job log makes
the applied state obvious.

Pin-and-fork is the long-term answer for any patch that lives here for
more than a few weeks; this script is the "ship now, deal upstream
later" hatch.

Patches currently applied
-------------------------

* **hbm_usage_bytes non-addressable device skip** (tpu_inference/utils.py)

  ``hbm_usage_bytes()`` iterates over every device in the JAX mesh and
  calls ``device.memory_stats()``. On multi-host TPU slices >v6e-8
  (v6e-16 = 4 hosts, v6e-32 = 8 hosts) each host can only address its
  4 local chips; calling ``memory_stats()`` on a non-addressable device
  raises ``jax.errors.JaxRuntimeError: INVALID_ARGUMENT: MemoryStats is
  only supported for addressable PjRt devices.``

  The patch adds a ``is_addressable`` guard to the non-Ray branch of
  the iteration so non-local chips are skipped instead of raising.
  This matches the Ray branch's behavior (which already short-circuits
  after the first successful device).
