"""Convert nvidia/Nemotron-RL-Instruction-Following-MultiTurnChat-v1 → Harbor
multi-criterion rubric judge task.

This is the MultiChallenge-style instruction-following benchmark: each row is a
multi-turn conversation (system prompt + several user/assistant turns) that
ENDS on a user turn, and the agent's job is to produce the FINAL assistant
response that satisfies a rubric. Grading is inherently subjective
(tone/structure/instruction-retention checks), so we use an LLM judge — one
call per rubric criterion.

Verified schema (2026-06, split `train`, 2011 rows):
  - `responses_create_params.input` : the multi-turn conversation as a list of
        {role, content} messages (system/user/assistant), ALWAYS ending on a
        `user` turn (the agent answers it).
  - `context` : a flattened transcript ([SYSTEM]/[USER]/[ASSISTANT] ...) of the
        same conversation. We use THIS as the instruction body + judge context —
        it's a clean human-readable rendering of the full multi-turn dialogue.
  - `rubric` : ALWAYS non-empty list (sizes 1/2/4/5/6) of grading criteria, each
        {question, pass_criteria}. `pass_criteria` is mostly "YES" (5128) but
        sometimes "NO" (150 criteria across 57 rows) — a NO criterion checks a
        constraint the model should NOT do (e.g. "Did it overwrite the
        three-sentence constraint?" → pass_criteria=NO). Honored generically.
  - `metadata` : topic / sub-topic / challenge / persona / turns; provenance.

Grading (see verifiers/multiturn_rubric_judge.py):
  - One judge call per criterion. The judge sees the full conversation, the
    agent's final response, and the single criterion question → YES/NO.
  - Aggregation: ALL criteria must match their `pass_criteria` for reward == 1
    (no partial credit); one mismatch short-circuits to reward 0. This mirrors
    the all-or-nothing nature of instruction-following constraints.

We did NOT reuse INVERSE_IFEVAL_JUDGE_VERIFIER_PY: that verifier assumes each
criterion's `content` is a fully self-contained grading prompt that already
embeds the instruction + reference answer. Here each criterion is only a short
question, so the verifier itself must supply the conversation transcript +
candidate response to the judge — hence the dedicated multiturn_rubric_judge.
