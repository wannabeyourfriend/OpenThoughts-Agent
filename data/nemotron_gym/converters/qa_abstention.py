"""Convert nvidia/Nemotron-RL-QA-Abstention-v1.

Short-factoid QA with an abstention protocol. Every row carries:
  - question (str)  : the question.
  - answer (str)    : the GOLD answer.
  - responses_create_params.input : a [system, user] message pair. The single
    (dataset-wide constant) system prompt instructs the model to answer with
    JUST the answer in ``\boxed{...}``, and to output ``\boxed{[IDK]}`` instead
    of guessing when it does not know.

ABSTENTION SEMANTICS — determined empirically from the data (all 3150 rows):
  * Every row has a real, non-empty gold answer.
  * No gold is empty / null / an "[IDK]"/"unknown"-like token.
Therefore this is an ALL-ANSWERABLE dataset: the correct behavior on every row
is to PRODUCE THE BOXED GOLD, never to abstain. The ``[IDK]`` token exists in
the protocol (the model is allowed to abstain to avoid being wrong) but the
dataset never makes abstention the rewarded action. Grading is therefore
boxed-answer-matches-gold (normalized text equality).

The converter still detects an IDK-like / empty gold defensively: if such a row
ever appears (schema drift), it is encoded so that boxing the abstention token
scores 1 (``abstention_token`` set in verifier_data). On the current snapshot
this branch is never taken.

Grading is SELF-CONTAINED (QA_BOXED_MATCH_VERIFIER_PY) — no LLM/network. The
answers are short factoids (publishers, years, percentages, single nouns), so
normalized string comparison (lowercase, drop thousands-separators, strip
punctuation + articles, collapse whitespace) plus a contiguous token-subsequence
fallback in either direction grades them well without going so loose that
unrelated answers pass.
