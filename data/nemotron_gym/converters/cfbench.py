"""Convert nvidia/Nemotron-RL-CFBench-v1 → Harbor HYBRID task.

CFBench (Complex / Constraint-Following Benchmark) rows mix two grading kinds:

  * `instructions` : IFEval-style structured constraints with inline kwargs and
    a relation vocabulary {"equal to","less than","more than","greater than",
    "at least","at most"}. Most are DETERMINISTIC.
  * `llm_judge`    : natural-language yes/no checks — SUBJECTIVE.

This converter produces a single HYBRID task graded by
`HYBRID_IFEVAL_JUDGE_VERIFIER_PY`, which runs the deterministic checks locally
AND an LLM judge over the subjective questions, combining them with the rule:

    reward = 1  iff  (all deterministic constraints pass)
                AND  (every judge question scores >= score_threshold)

Instruction-id routing
-----------------------
Each `instructions[*].instruction_id` is classified:

  * DET_IMPLEMENTED  — the hybrid verifier has a self-contained check. The raw
    constraint dict (instruction_id + inline kwargs) goes into
    `det_constraints`.
  * JUDGE_ROUTED     — inherently subjective (stylistic / situational /
    linguistic) OR ambiguous-unicode counting that a deterministic check cannot
    grade reliably across scripts. We DO NOT silently pass these: instead we
    render each into a natural-language yes/no question (via `_judge_question`)
    and append it to `judge_questions`, so the LLM judge grades it.

This keeps the brief's invariant: unsupported instruction_ids are never
silently treated as satisfied — they are either implemented deterministically
or explicitly checked by the judge.

Both degenerate cases are handled: a row with only `instructions` yields a
det-only / det+routed-judge task; a row with only `llm_judge` yields a
judge-only task.
