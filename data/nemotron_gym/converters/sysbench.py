"""Convert nvidia/Nemotron-RL-SysBench-v1 → Harbor HYBRID task.

SysBench is SYSTEM-prompt constraint following: a rich system prompt sets rules,
and each row carries TWO kinds of checks the final response must satisfy:

  * `instructions` (list): IFEval-style structured constraints with an
    `instruction_id` + inline kwargs, e.g.
    ``{"instruction_id": "keywords:existence", "source": "system",
       "keywords": [...]}``. Most are DETERMINISTIC.
  * `llm_judge` (list): subjective yes/no checks, e.g.
    ``{"content": "Does the response avoid prescriptive language?",
       "source": "system", "uid": 2}``. Graded by an LLM judge.

Strategy (identical shape to the CFBench task): emit a single hybrid task that
reuses `verifiers/hybrid_ifeval_judge.py`. The verifier runs the deterministic
constraints (`det_constraints`) AND the judge questions (`judge_questions`) and
combines them:

    reward = 1  iff  (ALL deterministic pass)  AND  (ALL judge questions pass)

instruction_id routing (decided here, at conversion time):
  * Deterministic-checkable ids that the hybrid verifier implements → emitted as
    `det_constraints` (graded offline, no key).
  * Inherently SUBJECTIVE ids (`stylistic:*`, `situation:*`) → rewritten into a
    natural-language yes/no question appended to `judge_questions`, so they are
    STILL CHECKED by the judge (never silently passed).
  * Any id the verifier does not implement → also routed to the judge with a
    generic phrasing (fail-safe; the verifier fails CLOSED on unknown det ids,
    so we must not emit them as deterministic).

The system prompt is preserved verbatim in the task instruction (via
`extract_prompt`, which prefixes the `[system]` role), so constraints that refer
to system rules remain checkable by the agent and the judge.

Degenerate rows: SysBench always has at least judge questions (0 rows are
empty); rows with only judge questions (no deterministic instructions) grade on
the judge alone, rows with only deterministic instructions grade on those alone.
