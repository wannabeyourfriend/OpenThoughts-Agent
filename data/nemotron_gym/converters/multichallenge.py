"""Convert nvidia/Nemotron-RL-Multichallenge-v1 → Harbor multi-criterion judge task.

MultiChallenge is a MULTI-TURN, persona-driven instruction-following benchmark.
Each row is a conversation (a persona system prompt + several user/assistant
turns) whose `responses_create_params.input` ALWAYS ends on a `user` turn — i.e.
the agent under test must produce the FINAL assistant response, which is then
graded against a list of yes/no criteria.

Verified schema (2026-06, two configs `advanced` + `vanilla`, splits `train`):
  - `responses_create_params.input` : multi-turn transcript (system persona +
        user/assistant turns), final message is the user request to respond to.
        Use it via extract_prompt; the FULL transcript is preserved when it fits
        the 64KB cap, otherwise a system+last-user trim fallback recovers it.
  - `llm_judge` : ALWAYS non-empty list of per-criterion judge specs, each
        {uid, content, pass_criteria, source, is_misalignment_check}. Each
        `content` is a SELF-CONTAINED grading prompt that re-embeds the entire
        conversation up to (but not including) the model's final response, then
        asks "Does the model's final response satisfy this criterion?" with the
        criterion text and an "Expected answer: YES/NO" line.
        advanced: 4-6 criteria/row (avg 4.0); vanilla: 1-2 criteria/row.
        `pass_criteria` is USUALLY "YES" but NOT always — a minority are "NO"
        (151/4169 advanced, 8/1335 vanilla). The verifier honors each spec's
        own pass_criteria, so this is handled faithfully.
  - `instructions` : ALWAYS empty ([]) — no deterministic ifeval constraints;
        grading is purely via the llm_judge specs.

Both configs share this repo id and have an IDENTICAL shape, so a single
registered converter handles both — run.py routes the config via its --config
flag at load time, not via a row field.

Grading (reuses verifiers/inverse_ifeval_judge.py):
  - One judge call per criterion → YES/NO verdict.
  - The criterion `content` already embeds the conversation; the verifier appends
    the agent's response (from /app/response.txt) under a "## Model's Response"
    section before sending to the judge, so the judge sees exactly what it needs.
  - Aggregation: EVERY criterion must match its own `pass_criteria` for
    reward == 1 (no partial credit). A single mismatch short-circuits to 0.

Cap handling:
  - The criterion `content` re-embeds the whole transcript and the criterion
    question is at the END, so truncating it would silently drop the question.
    We therefore size the per-criterion cap at the adapter's 256KB hard limit
    rather than the small Inverse-IFEval cap, and skip a row only if a criterion
    is so large that even sanitize_text rejects it (none observed).
  - The instruction.md prompt is separately capped at 64KB by extract_prompt;
    on overflow we fall back to system + final user turn (SysBench pattern),
    recovering the row rather than dropping it. The judge grading does not depend
    on instruction.md (the criterion content carries the full context), so a
    trimmed instruction never weakens grading — it only affects what the agent
    sees while composing.
