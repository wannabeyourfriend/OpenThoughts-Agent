"""Convert the citation-formatting instruction-following dataset.

Dataset:
  - nvidia/Nemotron-RL-Instruction-Following-Citation-Formatting-v1

Every row carries a deterministic `verifier` dict of the shape::

    {"type": "string_match",
     "patterns": ["\\[ref:2\\]"],            # regex (re.escape of the markers)
     "expected_markers": ["[ref:2]"]}        # literal substrings

Across all 9540 rows the verifier is uniform: `type == "string_match"`, both
`patterns` and `expected_markers` are present and equal-length, and every
`patterns[i]` is exactly `re.escape(expected_markers[i])`. The grading is
ALL-must-match (the answer must cite every required source marker). There is no
`match_mode` field and no `any` variant in the data.

Because each pattern is a re.escape of its literal marker, an all-of substring
check over `expected_markers` is semantically identical to an all-of regex check
over `patterns`. We therefore reuse the self-contained `substring_match`
verifier with `mode=all_of` and `case_sensitive=True` (citation markers such as
`[web:3]` vs `[Web:3]` are meant to be distinct). No LLM judge — fully
deterministic.

Rows whose verifier type is not `string_match`, or which lack usable
markers/patterns, are skipped (returned as None) and counted by run.py.
