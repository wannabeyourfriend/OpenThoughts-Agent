"""
Unified Eval Listener v6 - Polls Supabase for models and submits SLURM eval jobs.

Based on v5, with disk-based resume replacing the v5 DB-based DaytonaError resume.
Scans the eval jobs directory for incomplete/error-heavy jobs and resubmits them
with the same run_tag so harbor auto-resumes (skips completed trials, retries failed ones).

Key v6 features over v5:
  - Disk-based resume: scans --jobs-dir for incomplete/errored job dirs
  - Persistent sliding-window batch_size across iterations
  - hf_overrides support in baseline model configs
  - Supabase queries wrapped in try/except for resilience
Uses unified_eval_harbor.sbatch as the SLURM job template.

FLAG REFERENCE
===============================================================================

--- Preset & Dataset Selection ---

--preset, -p {aider,bfcl,medagentbench,gaia,financeagent,swebench,v2,tb2,v1}
    Load a named preset that bundles dataset, concurrency, error threshold, and
    other defaults tuned for a specific benchmark. CLI flags override any preset
    value. Almost all runs should start with a preset.

    Preset details:
      aider     Dataset: DCAgent2/aider_polyglot.       n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=10, thinking=on, config_yaml=no_override.
      bfcl      Dataset: DCAgent2/bfcl-parity.          n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=10, thinking=on, vllm_retries=20, config_yaml=no_override.
      medagentbench  Dataset: DCAgent/medagentbench.   n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=10, thinking=on, vllm_retries=20, config_yaml=no_override.
      gaia      Dataset: DCAgent/gaia_127.             n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=10, thinking=on, vllm_retries=20, config_yaml=no_override.
      financeagent  Dataset: DCAgent/financeagent_terminal.  n_concurrent=16 (SEC_EDGAR 10req/s cap; empirical p95 ~6.8 req/s aggregate at n=16, safe margin), error_threshold=10, thinking=on, vllm_retries=20, config_yaml=no_override.
      swebench  Dataset: DCAgent2/swebench-verified-*.   n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=15, thinking=on, vllm_retries=20,
                agent_parser=xml, gpu_mem=0.95, config_yaml=no_override. HF existence check on.
      v2        Dataset: DCAgent/dev_set_v2.             n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=10, thinking=on, vllm_retries=20.
      tb2       Dataset: DCAgent2/terminal_bench_2.      n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=10, thinking=on,
                gpu_mem=0.95, slurm_time=48h, config_yaml=no_override.
      v1        Dataset: DCAgent/dev_set_71_tasks.       n_concurrent=32, error_threshold=10, thinking=on, vllm_retries=20.

    Tuning: Pick the preset matching your benchmark. Override individual params
    with CLI flags (e.g. --n-concurrent 64 to double concurrency).

--datasets, -d <str>
    Comma- or space-separated list of HuggingFace dataset repos. Overrides the
    preset's dataset list. Use this for one-off evals against custom datasets.
    Example: --datasets "DCAgent/dev_set_v2,DCAgent2/terminal_bench_2"

--sbatch-script, -s <path>
    Path to the sbatch template. Default: unified_eval_harbor_v4.sbatch (or
    whatever the preset specifies). Only change this if you have a custom sbatch.


--- Model Filtering ---

--priority-file <path>
    Text file listing HuggingFace model names (org/model), one per line.
    Lines starting with # are comments; blank lines are ignored.
    File order = submission priority: earlier lines are submitted first.
    Hot-reloaded every iteration — edit the file without restarting the listener.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_PRIORITY_FILE

--priority-mode {filter_only,priority_first}    [default: filter_only]
    filter_only   — Only evaluate models IN the priority file. All others skipped.
    priority_first — Evaluate ALL models, but submit priority models first.

    Tuning: Use filter_only (default) when you have a curated list of models to
    evaluate. Use priority_first when you want to evaluate everything but ensure
    specific models get SLURM slots first.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_PRIORITY_MODE

--require-priority-list
    Safety flag. If set and no priority file is loaded (missing file or empty),
    the listener skips ALL models instead of evaluating everything. Prevents
    accidental mass submissions when a priority file path is misconfigured.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_REQUIRE_PRIORITY_LIST="1"

--blacklist-file <path>                          [v4 NEW]
    Text file listing models that should NEVER be submitted, same format as
    --priority-file (one model per line, # comments, blank lines ignored).
    Blacklist overrides priority: if a model appears in both files, it is blocked.
    Hot-reloaded every iteration, same as --priority-file.

    Tuning: Use this to permanently exclude known-bad models (e.g. broken
    checkpoints, models that consistently OOM, duplicates you don't want to
    re-evaluate). Faster than removing them from the priority file because
    the blacklist is checked first — no DB queries wasted on blocked models.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_BLACKLIST_FILE

--check-hf-exists
    Before submitting, validate that the model actually exists on HuggingFace Hub.
    Adds a network round-trip per model but prevents wasted SLURM jobs on typos
    or deleted models. The swebench preset enables this by default.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_CHECK_HF_EXISTS="1"


--- Timing & Lifecycle ---

--lookback-days <int>                            [default: 1000]
    How far back to query the Supabase `models` table (by creation_time).
    Priority models bypass this window — they are always fetched by name
    regardless of when they were added.

    Tuning: Keep this large (default 1000) to catch old models. Reduce only if
    DB queries are slow and you know all target models are recent.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_LOOKBACK_DAYS

--check-hours <float>                            [default: 4.0]
    Hours to sleep between iterations. Each iteration re-queries the DB, hot-
    reloads priority/blacklist files, and submits any new jobs.

    Tuning: For active development with frequent model uploads, use 1-2h.
    For stable production runs, 4-12h is fine. Ignored when --once is set.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_CHECK_HOURS

--stale-hours <int>                              [default: 24]
    A job in "Started" status older than this is considered stale and will be
    resubmitted. Covers cases where the sbatch job crashed without updating
    the DB to Finished.

    Tuning: Set to at least 1.5x your SLURM time limit. If --slurm-time is
    24:00:00, keep this at 24 (default). If you use --slurm-time 48:00:00
    (like tb2), bump to 48-72.

--stale-pending-hours <int>                      [default: 48]
    A job in "Pending" status older than this is considered stale. The listener
    will scancel the old SLURM job (if tracked) and resubmit.

    Tuning: Should be >= --stale-hours. Default of 48h gives Pending jobs extra
    time to get through the SLURM queue before being killed.


--- Sbatch / vLLM Parameters (passed to sbatch via env vars) ---

--n-concurrent <int>                             [default: 64, preset overrides]
    Number of concurrent Harbor evaluation jobs inside the sbatch. Controls how
    many sandbox tasks run in parallel against the vLLM server.

    Tuning: Depends on model size and GPU memory.
      - 7-8B models on GH200 (96GB): 32-64 is safe.
      - 32B models: 8-16 (higher causes vLLM queue buildup → AgentTimeoutError).
      - 131K context models: 4-8 (KV cache fills fast at high concurrency).
    If you see many AgentTimeoutErrors, reduce this. If eval is slow and vLLM
    GPU utilization is low, increase it.

--n-attempts <int>                               [default: 3]
    Number of retry attempts per Harbor task. If a task fails (e.g. sandbox
    timeout), Harbor retries it up to this many times.

    Tuning: 3 is good for most benchmarks. Raise to 5 for flaky benchmarks.
    Lowering to 1 speeds up runs but increases noise from transient failures.

--gpu-memory-util <float>                        [default: 0.9]
    Fraction of GPU memory allocated to vLLM via --gpu-memory-utilization.

    Tuning:
      - 0.90 (default): safe for 7-8B models on GH200 (96GB). Leaves headroom
        for GPU memory variance across nodes.
      - 0.95: used by swebench/tb2 presets for larger models or when you need
        maximum KV cache capacity. Risk: some GH200 nodes have slightly less
        available memory and will OOM at 0.95 (use --exclude in sbatch).
      - Never go above 0.95. Below 0.85 wastes memory.

--error-threshold <int>                          [default: 3, preset overrides]
    Maximum number of "invalid" errors allowed before the sbatch script aborts
    result upload. Invalid = any error type EXCEPT AgentTimeoutError,
    ContextLengthExceededError, SummarizationTimeout, SummarizationTimeoutError.

    Tuning: Controls quality gating. Low values (3) are strict — a few
    DaytonaErrors or unexpected crashes abort the upload. Higher values (10-15)
    are more tolerant, appropriate for benchmarks where some sandbox flakiness
    is expected.
      - aider: 3 (strict, small dataset)
      - v2/tb2: 10 (moderate, larger datasets with occasional flakes)
      - swebench: 15 (lenient, swebench sandboxes are flakier)

    --daytona-threshold is a backward-compatible alias for this flag.

--vllm-max-retries <int>                         [default: 5, preset overrides]
    Number of times the sbatch script retries starting the vLLM server.
    vLLM occasionally fails to start on first attempt (port conflicts,
    CUDA initialization issues).

    Tuning: 5 is fine for quick detection of real failures. Presets like v2
    and swebench use 20 for more resilience on busy clusters.

--agent-parser <str>                             [default: "" (none)]
    Parser type for Harbor agent output. Set to "xml" for swebench (which
    uses XML-structured agent responses). Leave empty for all other benchmarks.

    Tuning: Only change this if you're adding a new benchmark with a custom
    agent output format. The swebench preset sets this automatically.

--slurm-time <str>                               [default: "24:00:00"]
    SLURM wall-clock time limit for the sbatch job. Format: HH:MM:SS.

    Tuning: 24h is enough for most benchmarks. tb2 preset uses 48h because
    terminal_bench_2 tasks are longer-running. If jobs are hitting the time
    limit and getting killed, increase this and also bump --stale-hours.

--slurm-partition <str>                          [default: "gh"]
    SLURM partition to submit jobs to. On TACC, "gh" is the GH200 GPU partition.

--agent-name <str>                               [default: "terminus-2"]
    Agent name written to DB entries and used by Harbor for evaluation config.
    This determines which agent implementation Harbor uses to run the eval tasks.

--enable-thinking
    Enable thinking/reasoning blocks in vLLM model inference. Most presets
    enable this by default. Only disable if the model doesn't support thinking
    or you want to test non-thinking mode.

--upload-username <str>                          [default: current OS user]
    Username recorded in DB entries and result uploads. Auto-detected from
    the OS user if not specified.

    Env: EVAL_UPLOAD_USERNAME


--- v3 Enhancement: Per-Listener SLURM Throttle ---

--max-jobs-submitted <int>                       [default: 20]
    Maximum number of active SLURM jobs this listener instance is allowed to
    have running simultaneously. The listener tracks which SLURM job IDs it
    submitted and checks squeue to count only those still active.

    Tuning: This is PER-LISTENER, not global. Multiple listeners can run in
    parallel with independent budgets. Set based on your fair-share allocation:
      - Single listener: 10-20 is typical.
      - Multiple listeners: split your budget (e.g. v2=10, swebench=5).
    When the limit is reached, the listener queues submissions by priority
    order and drops the lowest-priority ones.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_MAX_JOBS


--- v3 Enhancement: Daytona Resource Pre-flight ---

--check-daytona-resources
    Enable Daytona API sandbox count check at startup and each iteration.
    If active sandboxes are at or above the limit, the listener skips that
    iteration entirely. Requires DAYTONA_API_KEY in environment.

    Tuning: Enable this in production to prevent overwhelming the Daytona
    sandbox pool. Not needed for small-scale or development runs.

--daytona-sandbox-limit <int>                    [default: 2000]
    Maximum expected active sandboxes. The listener skips submissions when
    the active count reaches this number.

--daytona-warning-buffer <float>                 [default: 0.9]
    Fraction of the sandbox limit at which a warning is logged. At 0.9 with
    limit=2000, warns when active sandboxes reach 1800.


--- v3 Enhancement: Model Retry Tracking ---

--track-model-retries
    Enable tracking of how many times each model has been started. Models
    exceeding the retry threshold are deprioritized (moved to end of the
    submission queue, not blocked entirely).

    Tuning: Enable this for long-running listeners to prevent repeatedly
    resubmitting models that keep failing. The sbatch script appends to the
    shared log when transitioning a job from Pending → Started.

--model-retry-threshold <int>                    [default: 5]
    Number of eval starts before a model is deprioritized. Deprioritized
    models are still submitted, just last in the queue (and may be dropped
    if --max-jobs-submitted truncates the list).

    Tuning: 3-5 for strict environments. Higher (10+) if transient failures
    are common and you want to give models more chances.

--eval-starts-log <path>                         [default: auto-generated]
    Path to the shared append-only log file where eval starts are recorded.
    Auto-generated with a benchmark+timestamp suffix if not specified.
    Multiple listeners using the same log file will share retry counts.

    Tuning: If you run multiple listeners for the same benchmark and want
    shared retry tracking, point them at the same log file.


--- v3 Enhancement: Timeout-Config-Sensitive Dedup ---

--timeout-aware
    Change job dedup logic to check model + benchmark + agent + timeout_multiplier
    instead of just model + benchmark. This allows running the same model with
    different timeout configurations without one blocking the other.

    Tuning: Enable when running A/B experiments with different timeout settings.
    When disabled (default), two listeners submitting the same model with
    different --timeout-multiplier values will conflict (one sees the other's
    job and skips).

--timeout-multiplier <float>                     [default: 1.0]
    Harbor timeout multiplier, passed to the sbatch job and stored in the DB
    job config. Values >1.0 give tasks more time; <1.0 makes them stricter.

    Tuning: Use with --timeout-aware for controlled experiments:
      --timeout-multiplier 0.25   (aggressive timeout, fast failures)
      --timeout-multiplier 1.0    (default)
      --timeout-multiplier 2.0    (lenient, for slow models)
      --timeout-multiplier 4.0    (very lenient, for debugging)


--- Execution Mode ---

--dry-run
    Preview mode: runs one full iteration (DB queries, filtering, status checks)
    but does NOT submit any sbatch jobs. Logs what WOULD be submitted. Implies
    --once. Use this to verify your flags before a real run.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_DRY_RUN="1"

--once
    Run a single iteration and exit. Useful for cron-triggered runs or one-shot
    submissions. Without this, the listener loops forever (sleeping --check-hours
    between iterations).

--verbose, -v
    Enable detailed logging: shows every model skipped (with reason), priority
    list contents, blacklist contents, and per-model DB status checks.

--log-file <path>
    Explicit log file path. Default: auto-generated in experiments/listener_logs/
    with a preset+timestamp name.

    Env: EVAL_LISTENER_LOG_DIR (for the directory)
